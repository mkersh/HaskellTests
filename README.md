This repository contains my Haskell tests and experiments.

To learn haskell I used http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out. Some of the examples are straight out of this.

Update: I started using the book above but then I swapped to http://book.realworldhaskell.org/. Main reason I am favouring this book now is because of the comments sections. Anyone that has read the book can comment on a particular topic. These comments are quite often very insightful.
